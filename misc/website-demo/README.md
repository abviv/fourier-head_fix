# website-demo

The project page contains a javascript visualization of the Fourier head learning a few different densities.
We include the details for generating those as well.
To generate the json files used in the website, run the following:

```bash
conda activate chronos
python run_exp.py
```

This will output the jsons into the `output` directory.
